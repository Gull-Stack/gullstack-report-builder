/**
 * Deposit and Redeposit Calculations
 *
 * Federal employees may owe deposits for:
 * 1. Non-deduction service (civilian service where retirement deductions were not withheld)
 *    - FERS deposit: 1.3% of basic pay earned during the period (3.1% for Congressional)
 *    - CSRS deposit: 7% of basic pay (7.5% for Congressional)
 *
 * 2. Redeposits (for service where retirement contributions were refunded)
 *    - Amount = refunded contributions
 *
 * Interest accrues on unpaid deposits/redeposits:
 * - No interest if paid before separation or within required timeframe
 * - After the interest-free period: variable rate set annually by Treasury
 * - Interest is compounded annually
 *
 * If deposits are not paid:
 * - FERS: service is not credited in annuity computation
 * - CSRS: service IS credited but annuity is actuarially reduced
