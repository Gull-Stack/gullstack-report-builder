/**
 * Survivor Benefit Calculations
 *
 * FERS (5 USC § 8419):
 *   • 50% election: annuity reduced by 10%; survivor receives 50% of UNREDUCED annuity
 *   • 25% election: annuity reduced by  5%; survivor receives 25% of UNREDUCED annuity
 *   • None:         no reduction, no survivor benefit
 *
 * CSRS (5 USC § 8341, OPM CSRS Handbook ch. 52):
 *   The retiree elects a "survivor base" (any whole-dollar amount up to the
 *   full annuity). The survivor receives 55% of that base. Annuity reduction:
 *     2.5% × first $3,600 of the base, plus
 *     10%  × remainder of the base above $3,600
 *   We model the two pre-set tiers (full = full annuity as base; partial =
 *   half of annuity as base). Custom bases supported via `csrsCustomBase`.
 *
 * The reduction is applied to the UNREDUCED annuity (before survivor election).
