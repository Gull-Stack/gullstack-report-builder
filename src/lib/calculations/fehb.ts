/**

 * In retirement, the government continues to pay approximately 72% of the

 * pays the remainder.
 *
 * Premium projections use compound growth at the assumed annual increase rate.
 *
 * Key rules:
 * - Must have been enrolled in FEHB for the 5 years immediately before retirement
 *   (or since first eligibility if less than 5 years)
 * - Government contribution ≈ 72% of the weighted average premium
 * - Premium is deducted from annuity (pre-tax under FEHB)
